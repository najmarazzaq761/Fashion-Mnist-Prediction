# Fashion MNIST Prediction using Deep Learning Models

This repository contains a project focused on predicting fashion categories using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale images, each representing one of 10 fashion categories. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to accurately classify fashion items.

## Overview

### Dataset
- **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset comprising grayscale images of fashion items in 10 categories: T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

### Task
- **Fashion Item Classification**: Using deep learning models to classify fashion items into their respective categories.

## Models and Techniques
This project employs various deep learning models and techniques, including:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Leveraging the power of CNNs to extract features from images and perform classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models to improve classification performance and reduce training time.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implementing dropout and batch normalization to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.
